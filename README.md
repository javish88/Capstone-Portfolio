# Capstone-Portfolio

## We aren't supplying any files for this project: what it looks like and how it works is up to you. You can use a framework like Twitter Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/ or Zurb Foundation https://foundation.zurb.com/ , or simply build the HTML and CSS from scratch. The design is up to you have fun. 

## Before you start

To prepare for this project you'll need to make sure you complete and understand these steps.

Have a GitHub account and know how to create a new repository and upload files to it.

## Have at least 4 portfolio-worthy projects for your portfolio.

## Place your finished portfolio and project files online using either:

a web hosting company

or, free hosting on GitHub pages, as described in the Publishing Websites Using GitHub Pages workshop.


## Mobile first design.

Create a mobile-first site that works well on mobile phones and desktop computers.

The design should be easy to use on smaller screen sizes as well as on the desktop.

320px is the smallest screen size you will need to test your design on.

Make sure the HTML files include the viewport meta tag in the head of the document, see the project resources for links to "Using the viewport meta tag" and "Configuring the Viewport".

## Images that link to at least 4 other projects.

The images can be images of your projects, icons, or whatever other visual represents the project.

You need to link to other web projects.

## A short description of each project and the skills you used to build it.

Employers want to know what you can do, so let them know what the project was and what you used to build it.

## Contact information

You'll want employers to be able to find and contact you.

You should include information like email, Twitter, and LinkedIn profile links for example. If you don't want to share this information for this project, no problem, just make these up.

## At least one example of JavaScript interactivity.

For example, you could use the pop-up effect from Project #5, the Interactive Photo Gallery. Or, use JavaScript or jQuery to trigger CSS transition effects or animations.

Have fun with this -- JavaScript is an important part of front end web development, so providing multiple examples of your JavaScript abilities will impress employers.

## Put your project in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account:

See the workshop Share your Projects with GitHub Desktop . The GitHub Desktop application can automatically create a new repository for you.

Make sure that you're only putting the files for this project in that repository.

## Publish your portfolio on GitHub pages, or with a web hosting company, so that the code reviewers can see your finished work.

## Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.

## You should also check for issues with your JavaScript code using JSHint, https://jshint.com/ .

JSHint may show you some warnings, so make sure to check through those for any potential problems.

You do not need to fix every warning listed but reviewing them can be useful.

## NOTE: A good practice is to check your project for cross browser compatibility. Making sure that it looks and functions correctly in multiple (at least three) browsers is an important part of being a top-notch developer. If you want, leave a comment to the project reviewer about which browser(s) the project was checked to ensure they are seeing things as you have designed them.

Some browser options:

Google Chrome

Mozilla Firefox

Internet Explorer/Edge

Safari

## Create a breakpoint for tablet displays.

## Link to more than 4 projects.

## Use SVG images for contact information icons.

## Multiple JavaScript interactions.
